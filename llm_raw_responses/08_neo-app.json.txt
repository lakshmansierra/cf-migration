Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can **transform your neo-app.json** into an **xs-app.json** for Cloud Foundry (CF), based on your provided content and plan.

### Key Points:
- **neo-app.json** is for SAP Neo environment; **xs-app.json** is for Cloud Foundry.
- **Destination routing** in xs-app.json uses `"destination"` type, not `"service"`.
- **SAPUI5 resources** in CF are usually routed via `"destination": "sapui5"` (if configured).
- **Duplicate routes** should be removed.
- **sendWelcomeFileRedirect** is not supported in xs-app.json.

## Transformed `xs-app.json` (for Cloud Foundry)

```json
{
  "welcomeFile": "/index.html",
  "routes": [
    {
      "source": "^/resources/(.*)$",
      "target": "/resources/$1",
      "destination": "sapui5",
      "authenticationType": "none"
    },
    {
      "source": "^/test-resources/(.*)$",
      "target": "/test-resources/$1",
      "destination": "sapui5",
      "authenticationType": "none"
    },
    {
      "source": "^/sap/opu/odata/(.*)$",
      "target": "/sap/opu/odata/$1",
      "destination": "WebIDE_1909",
      "authenticationType": "none"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes:
- **source/target**: xs-app.json uses regex for source and target paths.
- **destination**: Name must match your CF destination configuration.
- **authenticationType**: Set to `"none"` if not required, or `"basic"`/`"oauth2"` as needed.
- **Duplicate routes**: Removed for clarity.
- **sendWelcomeFileRedirect**: Not supported in xs-app.json, so omitted.

**Place this file in your `cf-root/xs-app.json` as per your plan.**  
If you need to add more routes or adjust authentication, let me know!
